(Verse 1)
 My darling you don't,
 Know a single thing about my past,
 Cause if you did you'd hurt and run away without asking.
 So what you wanna know you don't wanna know (Cause it will break your heart).
 So do you really wanna go where you know I don't?


(Chorus)
 Cause I can't find the means to start thinking bout yesterday.
 I don't wanna hear you say nothing bout yesterday.
 I don't wanna hear you say cause a new day has come,
 Another day that we've won, and I don't care about yesterday,
Yesterday is gone.


(Verse 2)
 Girl I don't want to deal, with a past that was left unspoken.
 Our love is made of steel with a lock that'll never be broken.
 So don't you cry about the answers I aint givin.
 This is for you, you and I.


(Chorus)
 Cause we don't need to be living for yesterday.
 I don't wanna hear you say nothing bout yesterday.
 I don't wanna hear you say cause a new day has come,
 Another day that we've won, and I don't care about yesterday,
Yesterday is gone.
Yesterday is gone.
Yesterday is gone.


You think that I don't love ya if I don't say every little thing about me,
 That I was doing yesterday.
 Whats done is done.
 Why can't you be the one,
 To love the man that you helped me become?


(Chorus)
Yesterday
 I don't wanna hear you say nothing bout yesterday.
 I don't wanna hear you say cause a new day has come,
 Another day that we've won, and I don't care about yesterday,
Yesterday is gone.
Yesterday is gone.
Yesterday is gone.
Yesterday is gone. yesterday
